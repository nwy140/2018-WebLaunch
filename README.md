# Bulma Workshop

This workshop has ended. IMO, it's definitely not as good as it would be.
As a speaker, I talk to fast, and assume too much things. Hence, I apologize
for not meeting your expectation.

The moment when you read this, it means, I'm not doing my job well enough.
At the same time, it also means, you as a student, put in effort to learn
this skill and knowledge. **Give yourself around of applause for that.**

If you have any questions regarding the code and why it is written
with this approach, feel free to ask at our Slack channal and Telegram.

### Material
- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EINM-2g2o4XJ43eMLRwzm-4Lw4sJFIDKSBjML1s015A/edit?usp=sharing)

### Tips and Tricks

- **Read through the documentation**. Really, it may sounds sarcastic, but it's really
  helpful. Copy and paste, and observe the outcome. Make changes and observe again.
- If you feel overwhelm by all of the complicated nested elements.
  - Start small. Learn how to use Elements first, like `button`, `form` elements.
  - Then take a look at how you can structure your website using Layouts like
    `container`, `section`, `columns` and `column`
  - Then slowly integrate more complicated components like `navbar`.
  - Remember, **you can always break the complicated code down into the smallest,
    simplest element/tag**.
  - Always start from the smallest component/element, and build upon it.
- Think of the nesting of `<div>` as lego blocks.
- Always make sure you **indent your code properly** and have sufficient
  space in between. It aids in the process on figuring out your error/typo.
  `Ctrl + A, Select Edit -> Line -> Reindent`
- Spot for typo or incorrect placement of closing tag `</div>`
- **Always close the tag after you open one**.
- **Utilize the folding feature** of your editor to reduce the complexity of
  your overall code. Sometimes, it helps you spot your incorrect placement
  of closing tag.
- **Ask for help.** That's why our club are formed. Don't feel shy to ask for
  help in Slack/Telegram. Everyone is learning. I am also learning on how
  to teach better.


### Closing

This is just the starting of your learning journey. To further improve:

- Learn from others people code. Visit their side, `Inspect Element`, and try
  to **clone a few simple pages or a few simple components**.
- Get inspiration from others. **Visit Bulma Expo or Templates** _(see Resources below)_, and see how people are using it.
- Learning doesn't stop at WebLaunch workshop. The STC community will be always
  be here if you face any questions when you're further learning about these topics.

To be honest, what we teach in the past few workshops, is limited, due to time constraint. You should go and explore more about it if you're really interested.
